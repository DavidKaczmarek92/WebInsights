## .env file
First, create an .env file in the root of your project:

```
COOKIE_SECRET = "cookie secret"
KEYCLOAK_DOMAIN = "keycloak domain"
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET = "your secret"
```

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
